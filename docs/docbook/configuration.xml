		There are some options you can use to configure and customize Phake. None of these options are required and
        Phake can always just be used straight out of the box, however some configuration options are available to
        provide more convenient integration with PHPUnit and ability to debug your mock objects.

        <title>Setting the Phake Client</title>
        <para>
            While Phake does not have a direct dependency on PHPUnit, there is a PHPUnit specific client that improves
            error reporting and allows you to utilize strict mode with PHPUnit. Without using the PHPUnit client, any
            failed verifications will result in an errored test. Generally speaking, with PHPUnit, the error result is
            reserved for bad tests, not failed tests.
        </para>
        <para>
            The other issue you would run into when using Phake with PHPUnit without using the PHPUnit Phake client is
            that any test runs utilizing the --strict flag will fail when an assertion is not recorded. By default Phake
            does not register assertions with PHPUnit. When the PHPUnit client is used however, the assertions are
            recorded and --strict mode can be safely used with your tests.
        </para>
        <para>
            To enable the PHPUnit Phake client, you can register it in your test bootstrap.

        <title>Setting the Mock Class Loader</title>
        <para>
            When generating mock classes, Phake will load them into memory utilizing the PHP eval() function. This can
            make the code inside of mock classes difficult to debug or diagnose when errors occur in this code. Using
            the Phake::setMockLoader() method you can change this behavior to instead dump the generated class to a
            file and then require that file. This will allow for accurate and easily researchable errors when running
            tests. This shouldn't typically be required for most users of Phake, however if your are having errors or
            working on code for Phake itself it can be incredibly useful.
        </para>
        <para>
            Phake::setMockLoader() accepts a single parameter of type Phake_ClassGenerator_ILoader. The default
            behavior is contained in the Phake_ClassGenerator_EvalLoader class. If you would instead like to dump the
            classes to files you can instead use the Phake_ClassGenerator_FileLoader class. The constructor accepts a
            single parameter containing the directory you would like to dump the classes to. The classes will be stored
            in files with the same name as the generated class.
        </para>

            Below is an example of the code required to dump mock classes into the /tmp folder.
